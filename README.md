# xglob

pure data (pd) plugin - list folder content

xglob-plugin is a "pure data" (pd) plugin.
Once installed, it allows you to obtain, via the "netsend" pd object, the list of files inside a folder.
In the pd patch you can use "xglob_request.pd".

"xglob_request.pd" is an abstraction of pd which is used to easily connect to the plugin (xglob.plugin.tcl).

From the "help -> browser" menu of pd you can open the file "xglob_request-help.pd" which contains the abstraction "xglob_request.pd" already initialized with the default parameters (address and port number).
